**Language/Stack:** {{Python|JavaScript|Java|Kotlin|...}}
**Topic:** {{Cloud|Kubernetes|Docker|AI|...}}
**Estimated Time:** {{X minutes}}
**Prerequisites:** {{tools, accounts, versions, prior knowledge}}

## 1. What You'll Build (or Learn)

Clear, outcome-focused bullets describing what the learner will achieve:
- Specific skill or feature they'll implement
- Key concept they'll understand
- Practical result they can show

**End Result:** One sentence describing the concrete deliverable.

**Repository:** (Optional) Link to starter code or final solution

---

## 2. Concept Overview (the "Why")

Short rationale and mental model (2-3 paragraphs):
- Why does this topic matter?
- What problem does it solve?
- When would you use this approach?

Use analogies if helpful. Keep it practical, not academic.

---

## 3. Minimal Runnable Example

The smallest possible example that demonstrates the core idea.

**Setup (if needed):**
```bash
# Installation or initialization commands
npm install package-name
# or
pip install package-name
```

**Code:**
```{{language}}
# Minimal working example
# Should be copy-paste ready
# Include comments for clarity
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Exact output the learner should see
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Brief practical pointer about the example (gotcha, best practice, or insight).

> ⚠️ **Warning:** (Optional) Common mistake or pitfall to avoid.

---

## 4. Guided Steps

Break down the implementation into clear, incremental steps. Each step should:
- Build on the previous step
- Be testable/verifiable
- Include code and explanation

### Step 1: {{First Action}}

Explain what we're doing and why.

```{{language}}
# Code for step 1
```

**What's happening:**
- Explain key parts of the code
- Highlight new concepts introduced
- Point out important details

**Test it:**
```bash
# Command to verify this step works
```

**Expected result:** What the learner should see.

---

### Step 2: {{Second Action}}

```{{language}}
# Code for step 2
```

**What's happening:**
- Continue building understanding
- Connect to previous steps

---

### Step 3: {{Third Action}}

```{{language}}
# Code for step 3
```

---

### Progress Check

After 2-3 major steps, include a checkpoint:

```
--- Progress Check ---

At this point, you should have:
- ✅ Specific achievement 1
- ✅ Specific achievement 2
- ✅ Specific achievement 3

If not, review [specific section] or check the Troubleshooting section below.
```

---

## 5. Variations (Optional)

Show alternative approaches or extensions:

### Variation A: {{Alternative Approach}}

```{{language}}
# Alternative implementation
```

**When to use:** Explain the trade-offs and use cases.

### Variation B: {{Enhancement}}

```{{language}}
# Enhanced version
```

---

## 6. Challenge

Give learners a hands-on exercise to reinforce learning:

**Task:** Extend the example by adding {{specific feature or modification}}.

**Requirements:**
- Specific requirement 1
- Specific requirement 2
- Specific requirement 3

**Hints:**
- Helpful pointer 1
- Helpful pointer 2

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

```{{language}}
# Complete solution code
# With explanatory comments
```

**Explanation:**
Brief walkthrough of the solution approach and key decisions.

**Output:**
```
Expected output from the challenge solution
```

</details>

---

## 7. Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls

### Error: "{{Specific error message}}"

**Cause:** Why this error happens

**Fix:**
```bash
# Exact command or code to fix it
```

**Explanation:** Why this fix works

---

### Error: "{{Another common error}}"

**Cause:** Root cause

**Fix:**
```{{language}}
// Corrected code
```

---

### Common Pitfall: {{Mistake Pattern}}

**Problem:** What people often do wrong

**Why it fails:** Explanation

**Correct approach:**
```{{language}}
// Right way to do it
```

---

## 8. Summary & Next Steps

### What You Learned

Recap the key takeaways (3-5 bullets):
- ✅ Core concept or skill
- ✅ Key technique or pattern
- ✅ Best practice or insight
- ✅ Common pitfall avoided

### Quick Reference

```{{language}}
// Minimal code snippet for future reference
// Just the essential pattern
```

### Next Steps

Where to go from here:
1. **Immediate:** Suggested next experiment or modification
2. **Explore:** Related topics or patterns to learn
3. **Deep Dive:** Links to official docs, advanced guides, or related tutorials
4. **Build:** Project idea that applies these concepts

**Recommended Resources:**
- [Resource 1 Title](URL) - Brief description
- [Resource 2 Title](URL) - Brief description
- [Documentation](URL) - Official docs

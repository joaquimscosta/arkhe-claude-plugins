# Thumbnail Design Brief: {{TITLE}}

**Purpose:** Create a compelling, clickable YouTube thumbnail
**Target Platform:** YouTube (desktop + mobile)
**Key Metric:** Click-through rate (CTR)

---

## Visual Concepts

Choose one concept or combine elements from multiple:

### Concept 1: {{Primary Visual Idea}}

**Core Visual:**
{{Describe the main visual element - e.g., "Split screen showing 'before' (messy code) vs 'after' (clean code)"}}

**Rationale:**
{{Why this concept works - e.g., "Shows transformation/value prop instantly"}}

**Reference Style:**
{{Optional: Link to similar thumbnails or describe visual style}}

---

### Concept 2: {{Alternative Visual Idea}}

**Core Visual:**
{{e.g., "Tech stack icons (Python + Docker + K8s) flowing into a deployed app"}}

**Rationale:**
{{Why this works}}

---

### Concept 3: {{Tertiary Visual Idea}}

**Core Visual:**
{{e.g., "Close-up of terminal with highlighted key command, glowing effect"}}

**Rationale:**
{{Why this works}}

---

## Text Overlays

**Primary Text (Headline):**
```
{{2-5 words maximum}}
EXAMPLE: "FastAPI in 10 Min"
```

**Font Guidance:**
- Bold, sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat Bold, Bebas Neue, Impact)
- High contrast against background
- Readable at 200px width (mobile size)

---

**Secondary Text (Optional):**
```
{{Supporting text if needed - single word or short phrase}}
EXAMPLE: "Production Ready"
```

**Font Guidance:**
- Slightly smaller than primary
- Complementary font or same font lighter weight
- Don't clutter - omit if primary text is sufficient

---

## Color Palette

### Primary Color
**Color:** {{e.g., "#FF6B00" (vibrant orange)}}
**Usage:** Text background, accent elements, borders
**Rationale:** {{e.g., "High energy, stands out in YouTube feed"}}

### Secondary Color
**Color:** {{e.g., "#1A1A2E" (dark blue-black)}}
**Usage:** Background, shadows
**Rationale:** {{e.g., "Professional, high contrast with primary"}}

### Accent Color
**Color:** {{e.g., "#FFFFFF" (white)}}
**Usage:** Text, highlights
**Rationale:** {{e.g., "Maximum readability"}}

### Contrast Checker
- Primary text on background: {{contrast ratio - aim for 4.5:1 minimum}}
- Ensure visibility at 200px width

---

## Composition

### Layout Structure
```
[Choose one or describe custom]
- Left 2/3: Visual | Right 1/3: Text
- Center: Text with visual elements around
- Top: Text | Bottom: Visual
- Full bleed visual with text overlay
```

### Rule of Thirds
- Position main subject at intersection points
- Avoid center-heavy layouts (often looks static)

### Focal Point
{{Where should the viewer's eye go first?}}
- "Viewer's eye should land on {{primary element}}, then read to {{text}}"

### Depth & Layers
- Background: {{e.g., blurred code editor or abstract tech pattern}}
- Midground: {{e.g., main visual element (logo, diagram, tool)}}
- Foreground: {{e.g., text with shadow/glow for separation}}

---

## Platform Considerations

### Desktop (1280x720px)
- Large text readable
- Complex visuals work
- More detail visible

### Mobile (200x112px effective)
- Text must still be readable
- Simplify visual elements
- High contrast essential

### YouTube Feed Context
- Thumbnail appears next to:
  - Other tech tutorials
  - Recommended videos
  - Search results
- **Stand out by:** {{e.g., "Using warmer colors than typical blue/gray tech thumbnails"}}

---

## Typography Details

### Primary Text
- Font: {{e.g., "Montserrat Bold" or "Bebas Neue"}}
- Size: {{e.g., "120pt (in 1280x720 canvas)"}}
- Color: {{e.g., "#FFFFFF"}}
- Stroke/Outline: {{e.g., "8px dark shadow for depth"}}
- Effects: {{e.g., "Subtle drop shadow, slight glow"}}

### Secondary Text (if used)
- Font: {{e.g., "Montserrat SemiBold"}}
- Size: {{e.g., "60pt"}}
- Color: {{e.g., "#FFD700" (gold)}}
- Effects: {{e.g., "Minimal, don't compete with primary"}}

---

## Visual Elements

### Logos/Icons
- Include if recognizable (Python, Docker, K8s logos)
- Keep small but visible
- Position strategically (e.g., corners or near text)
- Ensure official brand guidelines if using third-party logos

### Diagrams/Code
- Use sparingly - must be readable when scaled down
- Blur or simplify for background texture
- Syntax highlighting with high contrast

### Human Element (Optional)
- Face: Increases CTR if showing emotion (surprise, success)
- Pointing or gesture toward key element
- Keep facial expression aligned with content tone

### Emojis/Symbols
- Use strategically (✓, ⚡, 🚀)
- Don't overuse - can look spammy
- Ensure they render at small sizes

---

## Examples & References

### Style Reference 1
{{Describe or link to a thumbnail with similar style you want to emulate}}
- What works: {{e.g., "Clean, minimal, high contrast"}}
- Adapt by: {{e.g., "Using our color palette instead"}}

### Style Reference 2
{{Another example}}
- What works: {{e.g., "Bold typography, clear focal point"}}
- Adapt by: {{e.g., "Simplifying the background"}}

### Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)
- ❌ Text too small or too much text
- ❌ Low contrast (light text on light bg)
- ❌ Cluttered - too many elements competing
- ❌ Generic stock photos without customization
- ❌ Overly dark or overly bright (avoid extreme exposure)

---

## Production Specs

### Canvas Size
- **1280x720px** (16:9 aspect ratio)
- YouTube recommended resolution

### File Format
- **JPG** (smaller file size, good for photos/gradients)
- **PNG** (larger file size, better for sharp text/graphics)

### File Size
- Under 2MB (YouTube limit)
- Optimize for web without quality loss

### Safe Zones
- Keep critical text/elements away from edges
- Leave 10-20px margin from all sides
- Account for player controls overlap in lower portion

---

## Accessibility

### Colorblind-Friendly
- Test with colorblind simulator
- Don't rely solely on color to convey meaning
- Use shapes, contrast, and text

### Text Readability
- Minimum font size: 48pt on 1280x720 canvas
- High contrast: 4.5:1 or better
- Avoid decorative fonts that are hard to read

---

## A/B Testing Notes

If creating multiple variants, test:

### Variant A (This Design)
- {{Brief description of this concept}}

### Variant B (Alternative)
- {{What to change for comparison}}
- Example: "Same layout but warmer color palette"

### Metrics to Track
- CTR (click-through rate) - primary metric
- Retention (do clickers stay or bounce?)
- Audience demographics (who clicks more?)

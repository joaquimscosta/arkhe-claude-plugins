# Implementation Checklist

Validate clarity, flow, hierarchy, and accessibility before publishing.

## Message & Audience

- [ ] **One clear takeaway**: Can viewer state main message in one sentence?
- [ ] **Audience appropriate**: Language, complexity, and examples match target audience?
- [ ] **Goal alignment**: Does the infographic achieve its intended purpose (teach, compare, guide)?

## Structure & Flow

- [ ] **Obvious flow**: Reading path immediately clear (Z/F pattern, numbered steps)?
- [ ] **3–7 chunks**: Information broken into digestible pieces?
- [ ] **Minimal crossings**: Connector lines don't create visual confusion?
- [ ] **Legends present**: Icons, colors, and line types explained?
- [ ] **Progressive complexity**: Simple concepts before complex ones?

## Visual Design

- [ ] **Grid alignment**: Elements aligned to consistent grid?
- [ ] **Spacing consistency**: 16–24px increments maintained?
- [ ] **≤1 accent color**: Color palette restrained and purposeful?
- [ ] **Icons labeled**: Visual elements have text labels or legend entries?
- [ ] **Type hierarchy**: Title, headings, body text clearly differentiated by size/weight?
- [ ] **White space**: Adequate breathing room around all elements?

## Text & Content

- [ ] **Readable sizes**: Minimum 14px body, 12px annotations?
- [ ] **≤80 words per panel**: Text concise and scannable?
- [ ] **Jargon defined**: Technical terms explained or contextualized?
- [ ] **Code readable**: Monospace font, syntax highlighting if applicable?
- [ ] **Labels descriptive**: All diagrams, arrows, and connectors clearly labeled?

## Accessibility

- [ ] **Contrast AA**: Text meets 4.5:1 ratio (normal), 3:1 (large text)?
- [ ] **Color-independent cues**: Information conveyed through shape, label, or pattern—not color alone?
- [ ] **Alt text present**: Descriptive alternative text includes both structure and key takeaway?
- [ ] **Focus indicators**: Interactive elements have visible focus states (if applicable)?
- [ ] **Screen reader friendly**: Logical reading order when accessed non-visually?

## Export & Distribution

- [ ] **Social sizes exported**: Multiple dimensions for different platforms (1200×630, 1080×1080, etc.)?
- [ ] **Source file organized**: Layers named, groups logical, reusable components?
- [ ] **File formats**: PNG for social, SVG for web, PDF for print?
- [ ] **Usage guidelines**: Brief note on when/how to use this infographic?

## Validation Tests

- [ ] **5-second test**: Viewer identifies main message within 5 seconds?
- [ ] **30-second skim**: Viewer grasps overall structure and flow in 30 seconds?
- [ ] **Teach-back test**: Viewer can explain concept to someone else after viewing?
- [ ] **Fresh eyes review**: Someone unfamiliar with content can understand it?

## Final Polish

- [ ] **Spell check**: No typos in text or code?
- [ ] **Version noted**: Infographic dated or versioned (if subject to updates)?
- [ ] **Brand compliance**: Follows organizational style guide (if applicable)?
- [ ] **Legal review**: No copyright issues with images, icons, or content?

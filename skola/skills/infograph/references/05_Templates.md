# Templates

Six core templates for technical education infographics.

## Concept Map
**Best for**: Design patterns, mental models, architectural concepts

**Structure**:
* 3–5 central nodes representing key concepts
* Labeled edges showing relationships (verb + noun)
* Example panel demonstrating real-world application
* Legend for node types if needed

**When to use**: Explaining relationships between abstract concepts, design patterns, or system components.

## Process Flow
**Best for**: CI/CD pipelines, algorithms, data processing, workflows

**Structure**:
* 3–7 sequential steps in linear or branching flow
* Swimlanes for different actors/systems
* Dedicated error/exception lane
* Clear success and failure exit points
* Numbered steps

**When to use**: Sequential processes, state machines, decision trees, backpropagation.

## Algorithm Breakdown
**Best for**: Sorting algorithms, search algorithms, optimization techniques

**Structure**:
1. **Problem statement**: What are we solving?
2. **Intuition**: Why does this approach work?
3. **Pseudocode**: Step-by-step logic (numbered)
4. **Complexity**: Time/space analysis with notation
5. **Edge cases**: Common gotchas and constraints
6. **Example I/O**: Visual trace through algorithm with sample data

**When to use**: Teaching specific algorithms with mathematical foundations.

## Comparison Matrix
**Best for**: Technology choices, framework comparisons, feature analysis

**Structure**:
* Rows: Options/technologies being compared
* Columns: Evaluation criteria (performance, ease of use, scalability)
* "When to choose" callout boxes
* Small multiples for visual comparisons (acceptable)
* Visual indicators (✓, ✗, ⚠️) for quick scanning

**When to use**: Helping decision-making between multiple options.

## Architecture Snapshot
**Best for**: System design, microservices, distributed systems

**Structure**:
* **Layers** (top to bottom):
  - Clients (web, mobile, API consumers)
  - Edge (load balancer, CDN, API gateway)
  - Services (business logic, microservices)
  - Data layer (databases, caches, message queues)
  - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing)
* **Legend**: Icon meanings and protocols
* **Arrow types**: Synchronous (solid) vs asynchronous (dashed)
* **Annotations**: Key design decisions

**When to use**: High-level system overviews, microservices architecture.

## How-To Ladder
**Best for**: Setup guides, tutorials, deployment procedures

**Structure**:
* 4–6 step cards arranged vertically
* Each step includes:
  - Clear action title
  - Input requirements
  - Expected output
  - "Verify" checkpoint
* "Common errors" strip at bottom
* Visual progress indicator

**When to use**: Hands-on tutorials, installation guides, configuration procedures.

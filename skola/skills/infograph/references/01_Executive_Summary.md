# Executive Summary

## Goal
Enable fast, accurate infographic creation for technical education (programming, AI/ML, design patterns, cloud, architecture).

## Approach
* **Single takeaway**: One dominant message per infographic
* **3–5 chunks**: Optimal cognitive load for learning
* **Structure matches goal**: Pick the right template based on learning objective
  - Data-focused (comparisons, metrics)
  - Process-focused (workflows, algorithms)
  - Conceptual (relationships, patterns)
* **WCAG AA compliance**: Enforce accessibility standards
* **Orthodox shapes**: Prefer clear, labeled connectors for maximum clarity

## Framework Philosophy
Combine visual communication best practices with technical education requirements to create infographics that teach effectively while remaining visually accessible and professionally designed.

# Microlearning Foundations (Concise)

- **Chunking & Cognitive Load**: One concept, minimal steps, reduce extraneous detail.
- **Retrieval Practice**: Include a recap line or quick question at the end.
- **Spaced Repetition**: Chain micro-lessons over time; reference prior units briefly.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show runnable example first, then explain why it works.
- **Multimodal Delivery**: Pair text with visuals/code output for dual coding.
- **Continuity & CTA**: Always point to the next micro-unit to build momentum.

**Recommended Durations**
- Short video: 30–90s
- Micro-blog: 100–250 words
- Infographic: 3–5 key facts + single visual metaphor

**Quality Heuristics**
- First 3 seconds = hook value
- One-sentence takeaway present
- Measurable next step (CTA)

# Troubleshooting

## Too Long
- Trim to ≤90s or ≤150 words. Move extra detail to a follow-up micro-lesson.

## Not Actionable
- Add a runnable code snippet or concrete visual anchor.

## Unclear Audience
- Restate prerequisites and expected outcome in one line.

## Weak Continuity
- End with CTA that points to the next micro-lesson in the chain.

## Localization Issues
- Keep technical keywords consistent; translate surrounding narration naturally.

# AI Plugin

AI engineering toolkit for building production-ready LLM applications and intelligent agents.

## Components

### Agents

- **ai-engineer**: Build production-ready LLM applications, advanced RAG systems, and intelligent agents. Implements vector search, multimodal AI, agent orchestration, and enterprise AI integrations. Use for building AI-powered features in your applications.

- **prompt-engineer**: Expert prompt engineer specializing in advanced prompting techniques, LLM optimization, and AI system design. Masters chain-of-thought, constitutional AI, and production prompt strategies. Use when building AI features or improving agent performance.

- **context-manager**: Elite AI context engineering specialist mastering dynamic context management, vector databases, knowledge graphs, and intelligent memory systems. Orchestrates context across multi-agent workflows and enterprise AI systems.

### Commands

- **/improve-agent**: Systematic improvement of existing agents through performance analysis, prompt engineering, and continuous iteration. Use to optimize your custom Claude Code agents.

- **/multi-agent-optimize**: Optimizes multi-agent workflows for better collaboration, communication, and task coordination. Use when coordinating multiple agents in complex development tasks.

## Use Cases

✅ Building AI-powered features (search, analytics, recommendations)
✅ Optimizing prompts and Claude Code agents
✅ Managing context in complex multi-agent workflows
✅ Enterprise AI integrations

## Applies To

- Frontend AI features (chatbots, intelligent UIs, search)
- Backend AI integrations (ML models, data pipelines, analytics)
- Multi-agent workflow optimization

## Installation

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add ./arkhe-claude-plugins

# Install the AI plugin
/plugin install ai@arkhe-claude-plugins
```

## Usage

After installation, all agents and commands will be available:

```bash
# Use specialized agents
/agents
# Select from: ai-engineer, prompt-engineer, context-manager

# Use agent optimization commands
/improve-agent nextjs-frontend-engineer
/multi-agent-optimize
```

## Examples

### Building AI Features
```bash
# Use ai-engineer agent
/agents
# Select: ai-engineer
"Help me build an intelligent search feature with semantic similarity"
"Build a RAG system for document question-answering"
```

### Agent Optimization
```bash
/improve-agent ui-design-review
/multi-agent-optimize when using system-architect and database-architect together
```

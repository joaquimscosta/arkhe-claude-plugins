# Pattern: [Pattern Name]

> **Writing Guidelines**
> - **Be concise**: Focus only on design decisions, not implementation details
> - **Avoid duplication**: Don't repeat information that exists in component code
> - **Decision-focused**: Explain WHAT was decided and WHY, not HOW to implement
> - **Agent-friendly**: Write for consistency decisions, not technical documentation
> - **Test with question**: "If this component changed, would this design intent become wrong?" If yes, it's implementation detail that belongs in code.
